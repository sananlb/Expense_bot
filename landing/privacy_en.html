  <h1>CONSENT to personal data processing</h1>
  <p class="muted">Publication date: 2025‑09‑17</p>

  <p>I give my informed and explicit consent to the self‑employed sole proprietor Alexey Sergeevich Nalbantov (the “Operator”) to process my personal data in accordance with Federal Law No.152‑FZ of 27.07.2006 “On Personal Data” under the following conditions:</p>

  <h2>1. List of personal data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Telegram profile information (Telegram ID, user name)</li>
    <li>Data I provide while using the @showmecoinbot Telegram bot: records of expenses/income, amounts, currencies, categories, tags, comments, recurring operations, settings (language, time zone)</li>
    <li>Automatically obtained data: text and voice messages, interaction history with the bot, technical identifiers of subscriptions and payments (including Telegram Stars operations)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Important:</b> Voice messages are processed solely to recognize the content of the command/query, without biometric identification of the person.</p>

    <li>Tracking expenses/income, generating reports and statistics</li>

    <li>Sending notifications and replies to requests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Methods of processing</h2>
  <p>Collection, recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification (updating, changing), retrieval, use, blocking, deletion, destruction; automated and (if necessary) mixed processing.</p>

  <h2>4. Cross‑border transfer</h2>
  <p>I am informed and agree that my personal data may be transferred to foreign jurisdictions via Telegram and other services involved to ensure the bot operation. The scope of data is minimized.</p>

  <h2>5. Transfer to third parties</h2>
  <p>Personal data may be transferred to third parties (Telegram services and other providers — hosting, databases, monitoring/analytics, speech recognition/AI where applicable) solely to ensure the bot operation.</p>

  <h2>6. Term</h2>
  <p>For the entire period of using the bot and 3 (three) years after the end of use, or until consent is withdrawn unless otherwise required by law.</p>

  <h2>7. Withdrawal of consent</h2>
  <p>I may withdraw my consent at any time by sending a written notice to: <a href="mailto:help@tbotsupport.ru">help@tbotsupport.ru</a>.</p>

  <h2>8. Note</h2>
  <p>Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>

  <p><b>Important:</b> The Operator does NOT provide financial, investment, accounting, or tax advice. The bot’s results and materials are informational and do not replace professional advice.</p>
