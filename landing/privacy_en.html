  <p class="muted">Publication date: 2025‑09‑17</p>

  <p>I give my informed and explicit consent to the self‑employed sole proprietor Alexey Sergeevich Nalbantov (the “Operator”) to process my personal data in accordance with Federal Law No.152‑FZ of 27.07.2006 “On Personal Data” under the following conditions:</p>

    <li>Automatically obtained data: photos/scans of receipts and attachments, text and voice messages, files, interaction history with the bot, technical identifiers of subscriptions and payments (including Telegram Stars operations)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Important:</b> Voice messages are processed solely to recognize the content of the command/query, without biometric identification of the person.</p>

  <h2>4. Cross‑border transfer</h2>
  <p>I am informed and agree that my personal data may be transferred to foreign jurisdictions via Telegram and other services involved to ensure the bot operation. The scope of data is minimized.</p>

  <h2>5. Transfer to third parties</h2>
  <p>Personal data may be transferred to third parties (Telegram services and other providers — hosting, databases, monitoring/analytics, speech recognition/AI where applicable) solely to ensure the bot operation.</p>

  <h2>6. Term</h2>
  <p>For the entire period of using the bot and 3 (three) years after the end of use, or until consent is withdrawn unless otherwise required by law.</p>

  <h2>7. Withdrawal of consent</h2>

  <h2>8. Note</h2>
  <p>Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
